			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When converting an array to a List, Java uses a fixed-sized backed list. This means that the list uses an array in the implementation. While changing elements to
				new values is allowed, adding and removing elements is not.</p>

			<p class="link" id="10-43">10-43.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">B.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While no arguments are passed from the command line, this doesn’t matter because the main() method redefines the args array. Remember that String values sort
				alphabetically rather than by number. Therefore, 01 sorts before 1, and Option B is correct.</p>

			<p class="answerletters">D.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The public modifier allows access members in the same class, package, subclass, or even classes in other packages, while the static modifier allows access
				without an
				instance of the class. For these reasons, Option D is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because final is not related to access, and package-private prevents access from classes
				outside the package. Option B is incorrect because class is not a modifier; it is a keyword. Option C is incorrect because instance is not a Java keyword or modifier, and protected
				prevents classes that are not subclasses and are outside the package from accessing the variable. Finally, Option E is incorrect. The default keyword is for interface methods and
				switch
				statements, not class variables.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-45">10-45.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Looping through the same list multiple times is allowed. Notice how there are not braces around the loops. This means that only the print statement is inside the
				loop. It executes four times. However, the println() only executes once at the end, making Option A the answer.</p>

			<p class="answerletters">C, D.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The javac command compiles a .java file into a .class bytecode file, making Option C a correct answer, while also making Options B, E, and F incorrect. The javac
				command compiles to a set of java instructions, or bytecode, not machine instructions, making Option A incorrect and Option D correct.</p>

			<p class="link" id="10-47">10-47.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The parseInt() method returns an int primitive. Thanks to autoboxing, we can also assign it to an Integer wrapper class object reference. The char and short
				types
				are smaller than int so they cannot store the result. Therefore, lines 3 and 4 compile, and Option C is correct.</p>

			<p class="link" id="10-48">10-48.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">B, D, F.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The compiler will broaden the data type on a numeric value until it finds a compatible signature. There are two versions of the drive() methods that return a
				value
				of 3, one that takes a short and one that takes a double. Option A is incorrect because boolean cannot be converted to either of these types and trying to do so triggers a compiler
				error.
				Option B is correct because the data type short matches our message signature. Options C and E are incorrect. Remember that int and long are larger than short and will trigger
				different
				overloaded versions of drive() to be called, one that returns 5 and one that returns 2, respectively. Option D is correct. The byte value can be implicitly converted to short, and
				there
				are no other matching method signatures that take a byte value. Finally, Option F is correct because float can be implicitly converted to double, and there is no other version of
				drive()
				that takes a float value.</p>

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-49">10-49.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Trick question. This appears to be about equality, but it is really about you recognizing that the main() method is missing the static keyword. Running this
				problem
				gives a runtime exception because the main() method is not properly declared. Therefore, Option A is the answer. If this was fixed, the answer would be Option C because the int and
				String
				comparisons return true.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-50">10-50.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The code compiles without issue, so Options E and F are incorrect. Note that line p2 accesses a static method using an instance reference, which is discouraged
				but
				permitted in Java. First, a varargs int array of [0,0] is passed to the swing() method. The try block throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, since the third element is requested and
				the
				size of the array is two. For this reason, the print() statement in the try block is not executed. Next, since ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a subclass of RuntimeException, the
				RuntimeException catch block is executed and 2 is printed. The rest of the catch blocks are skipped, since the first one was selected. The finally block then executes and prints 4.
				Lastly,
				control is returned to the main() method without an exception being thrown, and 5 is printed. Since 245 is printed, Option D is the correct answer.</p>

			<p class="answerletters">E.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In the first iteration through the loop, container is 2 and cup is printed. Notice how the loop body subtracts 1 to account for indexes being zero based in Java.
				Then the update statement runs, setting container to 3. The condition is run and sees that 3 is in fact greater than 0. The loop body subtracts 1 and tries to get the element at index
				2.
				There isn’t one and the code throws an exception. This makes Option E correct. You might be tempted to think this is an infinite loop. If the body did not throw an exception, it would
				be!

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-52">10-52.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">A, E, F.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">An entry point in a Java application consists of a main() method with a single String[] or vararg String... argument, return type of void, and modifiers public
				and
				static. Note that the name of the variable in the input argument does not matter and the final modifier is optional. Options A, E, and F match this description and are correct. Option
				B is
				incorrect because the argument is a single String. Option C is incorrect, since the access modifier is incorrectly marked protected. Finally, Option D is incorrect because it has two
				return types, int and void.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-53">10-53.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">C, D, E.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For this question, it helps to remember that the value of a case statement must be a literal expression or a final constant variable, and have a compatible data
				type. For these reasons, Lines 10 and 12 do not compile, making Options C and E correct answers. Line 10 uses a constant value, but long is not compatible with switch statements, while
				Line 12 uses a variable that is not marked final. Next, a switch statement may only have one default block. Therefore, Line 11 or 14 must be removed. Since Line 14 is not in the list
				of
				options, Option D becomes the last correct answer. The rest of the lines are fine since removing Lines 10, 11, and 12 allows the code to compile.</p>

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-54">10-54.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">A, B, C.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">All of the compilation issues with this code involve access modifiers. First, all interface methods are implicitly public, and explicitly setting an interface
				method
				to protected causes a compilation error on line h1, making Option A correct. Next, lines h2 and h3 both override the interface method with the package-private access modifier. Since
				this
				reduces the implied visibility of public, the overrides are invalid and neither line compiles. Therefore, Options B and C are also correct. Note that the RuntimeException is allowed in
				an
				overridden method even though it is not in the parent method signature because only new checked exceptions in overridden methods cause compilation errors. Line h4 is valid. An object
				can
				be implicitly cast to a superclass or inherited interface. Finally, lines h5 and h6 will compile without issue but independently throw a ClassCastException and a NullPointerException
				at
				runtime, respectively. Since the question only asks about compilation problems, neither of these are correct answers.</p>

			<p class="answerletters">B, E, F.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Unchecked exceptions inherit the RuntimeException class and are not required to be caught in the methods where they are declared. Since ArithmeticException and
				IllegalArgumentException extend RuntimeException, they are included as unchecked exceptions, making Options B, E, and F correct. The rest are checked exceptions, which inherit
				Exception
				but not RuntimeException.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-56">10-56.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The code compiles without issue, making Options D and E incorrect. Applying the ternary ? : operator, the variable ship is assigned a value of 10.0. The
				expression
				in the first if-then statement evaluates to true, so Goodbye is printed. Note that there is no else statement between the first and second if-then statements, therefore the second
				if-then
				statement is also executed. The expression in the second if-then statement evaluates to false, so the else statement is called and See you again is also printed. Therefore, Option F is
				the
				correct answer, with two statements being printed.</p>

			<p class="answerletters">B, C, D.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The clock variable is accessed by a class in the same package; therefore, it requires package-private or less restrictive access (protected and public). The
				getTime() method is accessed by a subclass in a different package; therefore, it requires protected or less restrictive access (public). Options B, C, and D conform to these rules,
				making
				them the correct answer. Options A and F cause the Snooze class to fail to compile because the getTime() method is not accessible outside the package, even though Snooze is a subclass
				of
				Alarm. Option E causes the Coffee class to fail to compile because the clock variable is only visible within the Alarm class.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-58">10-58.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This problem appears to be to be about overriding a method, but in fact, it is much simpler. The class CarbonStructure is not declared abstract, yet it includes
				an
				abstract method. To fix it, the definition of CarbonStructure would have to be changed to be an abstract class, or the abstract modifier would need to be removed from getCount() in
				CarbonStructure and a method body added. Since the only answer choice available is to change the getCount() method on line q1, Option B is the correct answer. Note that the rest of the
				application, including the override on line q2, is correct and compiles without issue. The return types Long and Number are covariant since Number is a superclass of Long. Likewise,
				the
				exception thrown in the subclass method is narrower, so no compilation error occurs on q2.</p>

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-59">10-59.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Line 5 does not declare a main() method that can be the entry point to the program. It does correctly declare a regular instance method and does compile. Line 6
				does
				not compile because LocalDate needs to use a static method rather than a constructor. Line 7 is incorrect because Period methods should not be chained. However, it does compile,
				returning
				a period of 1 day. Line 8 does not compile because the correct class name is DateTimeFormatter. Line 9 is correct. Option C is correct because lines 6 and 8 do not compile.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A try block can have zero or more catch blocks, and zero or one finally blocks, but must be accompanied by at least one of these blocks. For these reasons,
				Options
				B, D, and F are incorrect, and Option E is correct. A finally block must appear after the last catch block, if there are any, making Option C incorrect, and Option A correct.</p>

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-61">10-61.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">B.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The code compiles without issue, so Option E is incorrect. For this problem, it helps to remember that + and * have a higher precedence than the ternary ? :
				operator. In the first expression, 1 + 2 * 5 is evaluated first, resulting in a reduction to 11&gt;=2 ? 4 : 2, and then fish being assigned a value of 4. In the second expression, the
				first ternary expression evaluates to false resulting in a reduction to the second right-hand expression 5&gt;=5 ? 9 : 7, which then assigns a value of 9 to mammals. In the print()
				statement, the first + operator is an addition operator, since the operands are numbers, resulting in the value of 4 + 9, 13. The second + operator is a concatenation since one of the
				two
				operands is a String. The result 13 is printed, making Option B the correct answer.</p>

			<p class="link" id="10-62">10-62.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">A, C, E.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">An object can be cast to a superclass or inherited interface type without an explicit cast. Furthermore, casting an object to a reference variable does not
				modify
				the object in any way; it just may change what methods and variables are immediately accessible. For these reasons, Options A, C, and E are correct. Option B is incorrect; since the
				compiler can try to block or warn about invalid casts, it cannot prevent them. For example, any object can be implicitly cast to java.lang.Object, then explicitly cast to any other
				object,
				leading to a ClassCastException at runtime. Option D is also incorrect because assigning an object to a subclass reference variable requires an explicit cast. Finally, Option F is
				incorrect. An object can always be cast to one of its inherited types, superclass or interface, without a ClassCastException being thrown.</p>

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-63">10-63.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The array is not sorted. It does not meet the pre-condition for a binary search. Therefore, the output is not guaranteed and the answer is Option F.</p>

			<p class="answerletters">B.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">While shoe3 goes out of scope after the shopping() method, the croc object is referenced by shoe1 and therefore cannot be garbage collected. Similarly, the
				sandal
				object is now referenced by shoe2. No variables reference the flip flop object, so it is eligible to be garbage collected, and Option B is correct.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-65">10-65.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The throws keyword is used in method declarations, while the throw keyword is used to throw an exception to the surrounding process, and the finally keyword is
				used
				to add a statement that is guaranteed to execute even if an exception is thrown. For these reasons, Option E is the correct answer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-66">10-66.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">B, E.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first two iterations through the loop complete successfully, making Option B correct. However, the two arrays are not the same size and the for loop only
				checks
				the size of the first one. The third iteration throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, making Option E correct.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-67">10-67.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">For this question, it helps to try all answers out. Most of them do not make any sense. For example, overloading a method is not a facet of inheritance.
				Likewise,
				concrete and abstract methods can both be overridden, not just one. The only answer that is valid is Option E. Without virtual methods, overriding a method would not be possible, and
				Java
				would not truly support polymorphism.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-68">10-68.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The code does compile. Line s1 is a bit tricky because length is used for an array and length() is used for a String. Line s1 stores the length of the Fall in a
				variable, which is 4. Line s2 throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because 4 is not a valid index for an array with four elements. Remember that indices start counting with zero.
				Therefore, Option E is correct.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-69">10-69.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">D.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The code definitely does not compile, so Option A is incorrect. The first problem with this code is that the Drum class is missing a constructor causing the
				class
				declaration on line 8 to fail to compile. The default no-argument constructor cannot be inserted if the superclass, Instrument, does not define a no-argument constructor. The second
				problem with the code is that line 11 does not compile, since it calls super.play(5), but the version of play() in the parent class does not take any arguments. Finally, line 15 does
				not
				compile. While mn may be a reference variable that points to a Drum() object, the concert() method cannot be called unless it is explicitly cast back to a Drum reference. For these
				three
				reasons, the code does not compile, and Option D is the correct answer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-70">10-70.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">B.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The application compiles and runs without issue, so Options E and F are incorrect. Java uses pass-by-value, so even though the change to length in the first line
				of
				the adjustPropellers() method does not change the value in the main() method, the value is later returned by the method and used to reassign the length value. The result is that length
				is
				assigned a value of 6, due to it being returned by the method. For the second parameter, while the String[] reference cannot be modified to impact the reference in the calling method,
				the
				data in it can be. Therefore, the value of the first element is set to LONG, resulting in an output of 6,LONG, making Option B the correct answer.</p>

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-71">10-71.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">D.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The first compilation problem with the code is that the second catch block in openDrawbridge() is unreachable since CableSnapException is a subclass of
				OpenDoorException. The catch blocks should be ordered with the more narrow exception classes before the broader ones. Next, the variable ex is declared twice within the same scope
				since it
				appears in the second catch block as well as the embedded try-catch block. Finally, the openDrawbridge() method declares the checked Exception class, but it is not handled in the
				main()
				method with a try-catch block, nor in the main() method declaration. For these three reasons, Option D is correct.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Object orientation is the property of structuring an object with its related data and methods. Encapsulation is the property of removing direct access to the
				underlying data from processes outside the class. The two go hand and hand to improve class design, making Option D the correct choice.</p>

			<p class="link" id="10-73">10-73.</p>
			<p class="answerletters">E.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In Java, String is a class and not a primitive. This means it needs to begin with an uppercase letter in the declaration. The code does not compile, making

		<div class="answer">
			<p class="link" id="10-74">10-74.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This class is called with three command-line arguments. First the array is sorted, which meets the pre-condition for binary search. At this point, the array
				contains
				[flower, plant, seed]. The key is to notice the value of args[0] is now flower rather than seed. Calling binary search to find the position of flower returns 0, which is the index
				matching
				that value. Therefore, the answer is Option A.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A for-each loop is a specialized loop that just iterates through an array or list. It can be rewritten using explicit indexing code in any of the other three
				loop
				types. Therefore, Options B, C, and D are correct. Option A is incorrect because a do-while loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. Option E is incorrect because the traditional

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">All arrays are objects regardless of whether they point to primitives or classes. That means both balls and scores are objects. Both are set to null so they are

				two
				objects exist to be eligible for garbage collection, and Option C is correct.</p>

				will
				be 1 assuming the loop completes. Subtracting a month from JANUARY results in DECEMBER. Since the loop completes E is incorrect and Option B is the answer. Note that if the brackets

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Line 10 does not compile because the override reduces the visibility of an inherited method, with the package-private modifier being more restrictive than the
				protected modifier. Line 11 does also not compile, since the left-hand side of a compound assignment operator must be used with a variable, not a method. Finally, Line 12 does not
				compile
				because super.grunt() is inherited as an abstract method in the PolarBear class, meaning the parent class has no implementation. For these three reasons, Option D is the correct
